The `getTimeAgo` function in the `astroblog/src/pages/search.astro` file is a utility function that calculates the time difference between the current date and a given date, and formats this difference as a human-readable string. Here's a detailed breakdown of the function:

1. **Current Date**: The function starts by creating a new `Date` object, which represents the current date and time.

2. **Date Difference**: It then calculates the difference in milliseconds between the current date and the given date (`new Date(date)`). This is done by subtracting the time value of the given date from the time value of the current date.

3. **Days Difference**: The difference in milliseconds is converted to days by dividing it by the number of milliseconds in a day (1000 milliseconds * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours).

4. **Flooring**: The result of the division is floored (rounded down) using `Math.floor()`, as we are interested in the whole number of days.

5. **String Formatting**: Finally, the function returns a string that represents the number of days as a human-readable phrase. It uses template literals to construct the string, which includes the number of days and the phrase "hari yang lalu" (which translates to "days ago" in Indonesian).

Here's the function code for reference:

```javascript
const getTimeAgo = (date) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const diff = now.getTime() - new Date(date).getTime();
  const days = Math.floor(diff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  return `${days} hari yang lalu`;
};
```

This function is used in the Astro component to display how long ago each article was published, providing a more user-friendly representation of the publication date.
